# WeatherTalk

### By Jordan Speizer

This project is a simple front-end app built in Angular. Using the Weather Underground and Twitter APIs, it allows the user to see the weather and relevant tweets from any location in the domestic US. 

The project is loosely based off [Angular Seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed), with quite a few modifications made.
